                    <p>Technology can be described as the use of knowledge in the design and production of 
                    devices and equipment that can be used in a variety of ways. For each and every one of us, 
                    technology has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. Despite the fact that 
                    technology has made life easier for all of us.Technology has existed since the beginning of
                    time. We have always had different forms of technology at different points in our civilisation 
                    as humans.</p>
                    <br>

                    Learning is one aspect of technology that has a significant impact on society. 
                    It has become more interactive and collaborative, allowing people to 
                    better engage with the material they are learning and having difficulty with.
                    Students can take quizzes and exams more easily, and teachers can hold more effective 
                    online classes. It also pushes the classroom's boundaries, encouraging self-paced learning. 
                   It can alse be accessed throght different social media platforms. This is more beneficial to student's
                    learning than sitting in lectures and reading textbooks. Learning has become easier as a result 
                    of technological advancements.</p></section>

                    Similarly, Comunication is the huge impact in our live that technology has made.Many
                    new forms of electronic communication have emerged as a result of technological
                    advancements. For example, there are emails, social networking, the ability to facetime
                    someone on the other side of the world, and video conferencing, which allows you to hold
                    virtual meetings.<br><br>Finally, technological advancements in the health industry have
                    aided in keeping people safe and healthy. There are numerous innovative phone apps that 
                    allow people to keep track of their weight, calorie intake,nheart rate, and other health
                    metrics at any time of day.<br><br>
                    
                
                        However, surveys indicate that mobile media has a negative impact on people's ability
                        to be sociable and make face-to-face conversation. Mobile technology has the potential
                        to reduce interpersonal contact and relationships. There is less free time, and you may
                        find that you do not have enough time for yourself when you are always in touch with 
                        others. It may also be a source of distraction from your studies.

                    <h2> What makes technology good or bad for humans?</h2>

                        <p>
                    Although there are several examples of how technology has impacted our lives, there are a
                    few that may be termed revolutions for humanity. One such example is the technology employed
                    in the field of robotics. People and companies all around the globe are now using robots for
                    a variety of purposes.They're also deployed in regions that might  be dangerous to people, 
                    i.e safeguarding us. Cleaning and disposal of radioactive waste is one of these areas.
                    Another sector that is a great illustration of man's technical accomplishments is 
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI). It's a machine that's intelligent is enough to act 
                    like us. AI can carryout the operations such as problem-solving, planning, learning, 
                    and even thinking. AI is now employed in almost every major industry, including defense, 
                    security, healthcare, and communication. Therefore, we can say that Technology has made is really
                    good impact in human's life.<br><br>
                    But in the other hand, some people are deeply opposed to technology, claiming that it will lead to
                    the extinction of ‘humanity'and that we are on the verge of a world where robots would govern everything.
                    Therefore, we can assume that technology can turn out bad on human life.
